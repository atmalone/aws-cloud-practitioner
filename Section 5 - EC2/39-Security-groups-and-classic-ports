Security groups are the fundamental of network Security in AWS
They control how traffic is allowed into and out of our EC2 instances.


They contain allow rules.
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group.

They are a firewall on our EC2 instances
They regulate:
    Access to ports
    Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 / IPv6
    Control inbound network (from other to the instances)
    Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

A security group can be attached to multiple instances
Locked down to a region / VPC combination
Does live outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it.

If your application give "connection refused" error, then its application error or its not launched
All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
All outbound traffic is Authorised by default
